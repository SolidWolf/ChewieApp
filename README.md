# ChewieApp

After being being part of this community I have decided to finally give something back.
Due to its popularity the website has been very useful in allowing Chewie to interact with his community.
As such I wanted to take it a step further and create an Android App to bring the website to a more mobile friendly version.

This is the website - https://chewiemelodies.com/

The mobile application will have the same functionality as the website with a different feel to it. 
The pictures below show how it looks and feels currently. I will post more pictures as I complete more functionality.
